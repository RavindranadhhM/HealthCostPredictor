# HealthCostPredictor 💊📊

A machine learning project that predicts individual healthcare expenses using regression on insurance data. Built with TensorFlow, this project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train a model, and evaluate its performance — all to estimate healthcare costs accurately! 💡🤖

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing with categorical encoding and normalization 🔄
- Neural network regression model built with TensorFlow/Keras 🧠
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting ⏹️
- Achieves Mean Absolute Error (MAE) under $3500 on test data 🎯
- Visualization of true vs predicted healthcare expenses 📉📈

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Run the notebook in Google Colab or your local environment  
3. The model trains and evaluates on the insurance dataset  
4. Check the MAE metric and prediction plots!

## 📁 Dataset

The data used is the [Insurance Dataset](https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/health-costs/insurance.csv) provided by FreeCodeCamp.

## 📈 Results

The trained model predicts healthcare expenses with high accuracy, helping in budgeting and insurance analytics.
